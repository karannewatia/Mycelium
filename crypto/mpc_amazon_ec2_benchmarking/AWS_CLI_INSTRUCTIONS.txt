AWS CLI INSTRUCTION

Instructions for installing AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html


First you need to create an account that you will use to access AWS through the CLI. You have to do this in the management console.

1. First create a group: go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/groups
	a. Click “Create New Group”
	b. Enter a name.
	c. Select an appropriate policy for the group. (If one does not exist, you can also make your own policies.) 
	d. Review and click “Create Group.”
	
2. Then create a user for this group.
	a. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users
	b. Click “Add User.”
	c. Enter the user name. Select “Programattic Access.”
	d. Choose the group you created.
	e. Ignore the tags section. You don’t need any.
	f. Review and click “Create User.”
	g. This will bring you to a page which has the user’s security credentials. Stay on this page. You will need these.

3. Then configure your client to use those security credentials.
	a. Open terminal
	b. Enter:
		$ aws configure
	c. Enter the security credentials from the command console.

  
4. AWS will probably have set up a default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for you and a default Security Group for you as well. However, you should modify the security group to allow you to SSH to your server.
	a. Go to the console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1. (or appropriate region)
	b. Click Security Groups (on the left-hand menu)
	c. Select the “default” group.
	d. Select “Inbound”
	e. Click “Edit”
	f. Click “Add rule”
	g. Add an SSH rule (TCP, 22) accessible from anywhere
